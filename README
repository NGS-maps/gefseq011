maps programs for GeF-seq analysis
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We made a significant modification for the Gef-seq analysis recently, 
Please check out the link including the latest releases. 
June 2017.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------
MAC OSX Mountain Lion Version
-------------------------------------------------


There are three binary files of maps programs (mkindex, mpsmap, pmapsr) compiled for MacOSX 10.7.5 (Mountain Lion). 
Change mode to make them executable, if necessary. 
% chmod +x mkindex 
% chmod +x mpsmap 
% chmod +x pmapsr 
You may also need to set path to this directory, if you carry out data analysis somewhere else.


------------------------------------------------------
Brief introduction to a GeF-seq analysis: 
------------------------------------------------------

Following is an example of a GeF-seq analysis. 

1. Preparation: 

Suppose you have three data files for analysis. 
1. Genome sequence file in fasta format (genome.fasta). 
2. Genome sequencing data file by Illumina sequencer in fastq format (genome_seq.fastq). 
3. GeF-seq sequencing data file by Illumina sequencer in fastq format (gef_seq.fastq). 
Read length of about 75 base pairs is assumed.

First, create an index file for reference genome. 
% ./mkindex -11 genome.fasta
The option -11 specifies the length of the index as 11.
This will create an index file genome.fasta.indx11


2. Genome-seq mapping: 

Then map genome-seq reads to the reference. 
% mpsmap -i 11 -a 8 -r 36 -h 35 -job r36h35i11 genome.fasta genome_seq.fastq
The options -i, -a, -r, -h, and -job specifies the index length, number of processors/thread used for calculation,
iteration cycle, maximum number of mismatch per read, and jobname, respectively.
Job name can be any string to specify the job. We usually use iteration cycle, mismatch allowance, and index length as the job name.
The second last and the last arguments are the genome sequence file and the genome sequencing data file, respectively.
This will create several output files including genome_seq.fastq_r36h35i11.bhit (hit position file:binary),
genome_seq.fastq_r36h35i11.hit (hit position file:text). 


3. ORI-TER bias estimation: 

To estimate the population bias between ORI and TER positions, issue the following command.
% pmapsr -job r36h35i11 -pek 10 -sr 2 -primer -np genome.fasta genome_seq.fastq
By specifying the same job name as the previous command, it will read the .hit file created by the previous command.
The -np option omits the output of postscript file, that saves some computational time and disk space.
The -sr option filters out reads with more than 2 mismatches to reference.
The option -pek specifies the width of genome sequence (the specified valu x 1,000) to calculate the population. 
For instance, by specifying -pek 10, it will calculate the population of every 10,000 bp on genome. 
Now, the population histogram file genome_seq.fastq_r36h35i11.pek should be created.
The file is a text file with (genome length / 10,000) lines, which looks like following.

==================================
=== genome_seq.fastq_r36h35i11.pek ===
==================================
       0    10000  2127237
 .........................
 2080000  2090000   412411
 ..........................
 3950000  3960000  2226115
==================================

The first and second columns indicate the initial and final position of the genome region.
The last column shows the total population of the mapped read in the region.
By plotting the population value on the genome and assuming the ORI and TER positions,
one can calculate the approximate slope of the population bias between ORI and TER.
In the following example we assume the slope as 0.1938 with ORI position of 0, and TER position of 2018418 for Bacillus subtilis genome.


4. Obtaining depth map: 

The following analysis of GeF-seq data expect the use of "IMC (in silico MolecularCloning)" software available from in silico biology, inc..
Our maps suite programs output data that can be read in by IMC for graphical analysis.

To obtain the genome mapping result as depth count on each genome positions, issue the following command. 
% pmapsr -job r36h35i11 -peb 1 -primer -sr 2 -pfs 100000 -pbo 0 -pbt 2018418 -pbs 0.23419 genome.fasta genome_seq.fastq 
The options -pbo -pbt -pbs specifies the parameters for ORI-TER bias.
The -pbo value specifies the ori position.
The -pbt value specifies the ter position.
The -pbs value specifies the slope for the ORI-TER bias.
The -peb option generates the following two files that can be read in from IMC program. 
The -primer option is for the reads with primer sequence which should be removed for depth counting.
This option is not necessary if regular genome sequencing is carried out.
The -sr 2 option removes the reads with more than 2 mismatches excluding the primer region.
IMC software may not work with data too large.
In such a case, user can split the output file into files with specified length by using the -pfs option.
Here we specify the file size as 100,000, so we obtain 43 files for Bacillus subtilis.

============================================
=== genome_seq.fastq_r36h35i11_match_001.peb === 
============================================
0,0,+,0
1,1,+,150
2,2,+,160

99997,99997,+,-1
99998,99998,+,-1
99999,99999,+,-1
============================================

The .peb file is a csv file with the first two columns indicating the genome positions,
plus or minus sign indicating the direction of reads, and the population at the position follows.
The -1 value for the population means it is within the excluded area such as rRNA region.
In the former file, the population is counted as a sum of both direction of reads, 
while the following file contains the population of each direction of reads separately.

==============================================


5. GeF-seq mapping: 

To obtain the plot of population for every 10 base pairs, set the -peb parameter as 10, with an appropreate -pfs value.

Next, map the GeF-seq data on the reference as following.
% mpsmap -a 8 -i 11 -r 36 -h 35 -map -job r36h35i11 genome.fasta gef_seq.fastq
Then you will get the hit position files (gef_seq.fastq_r36h35i11.hit, gef_seq.fastq_r36h35i11.bhit) and several other files.


6. GeF-seq depth: 

Using the mapped data, generate .peb files with the following command.
% pmapsr -sr 2 -job r36h35i11 -peb 1 -pfs 100000 -primer -pbo 0 -pbt 2018418 -pbs 0.193873 -np genome.fasta gef_seq.fastq 

This will provides the population files (gef_seq.fastq_r36h35i11_match_###.peb, gefseq_fastq_r36h35i11_fr_match_###.peb).
as well as the primer edge peak files (gef_seq.fastq_r36h35i11_edge_###.peb, gefseq_fastq_r36h35i11_pos_r_###.peb, geseq_fastq_r36h35i11_neg_r_###.peb),




Typing each command without argument will show some options and usages.
